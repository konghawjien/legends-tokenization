# Forgotten Legends NFT – Tokenizing Mythical Identities

**A cultural preservation project using NFTs to immortalize forgotten legends, mythical figures, and ancestral stories across civilizations.**

---

## 🌌 Project Vision

Across the world, countless mythical heroes, folklore guardians, and ancestral spirits have been buried under time and silence.  
This project seeks to **resurrect and preserve those unsung legends** through blockchain technology — by turning their identities into unique, collectible NFTs.

> We don’t just mint tokens.  
> We mint legacy.

## 🔥 Core Objectives

- **Tokenize**: Create NFT representations of forgotten or underrepresented mythical figures.
- **Preserve**: Digitally safeguard stories, names, and symbols that risk being lost forever.
- **Empower**: Allow communities and artists to co-create and benefit from cultural memory.
